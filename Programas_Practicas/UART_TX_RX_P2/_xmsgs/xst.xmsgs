To enable synthesis of FPGA/CPLD hardware, XST will assume that all necessary signals are present in the sensitivity list. Please note that the result of the synthesis may differ from the initial design specification. The missing signals are:

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2117" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">estado_1</arg>&gt; of Case statement line <arg fmt="%s" index="2">0</arg> was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
